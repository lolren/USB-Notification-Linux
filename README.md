# USB-Notification-Linux
As almost all Linux distro`s are lacking usb sound notification, I have made a easy script to add them. Enjoy

Place the sounds and the install files inside the same directory

sudo chmod +x USB-Notification-Installer.sh
sudo ./USB-Notification-Installer.sh
choose the options from the install menu
enjoy.
Tested on KDE Neon Distro
Should work on every systemd distro
If you want your own sound files, just replace the 2 .WAV files with your own. 
Njoy
